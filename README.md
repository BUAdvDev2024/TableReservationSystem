<h1>Table Reservation System</h1>
<p>This repository will allow users to make table reservations depending on the availability of the restaurant. For this we will be creating an API which will interact with a database.</p>
<br>
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Users should be able to select a date, time, and number of people for their reservation.</li>
  <li>Users would expect to be able to change or cancel their booking if plans change.</li>
  <li>Users should be able to see if the selected date and time have tables available</li>
  <li>Users should be able to cancel a booking</li>
  <li>Once the booking is successful, users could get an immediate confirmation message or email with reservation details.</li>
  <li>The system should prompt the user to enter their name, email, and phone number for confirmation and communication.</li>
  <li>Users would expect that their personal details are handled securely and are not misused.</li>
  <li>Users could expect to receive a reminder email or SMS closer to the reservation time.</li>
  <li>Users could add in a special message such as dietary preferences, high chair requests, or seating preferences (e.g., indoor/outdoor).</li>
  <li>If no tables are available at their preferred time, users could opt to join a waitlist.</li>
</ul>
