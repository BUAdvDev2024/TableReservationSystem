<h1>Table Reservation System</h1>
<p>This repository will allow users to make table reservations depending on the availability of the restaurant. For this we will be creating an API which will interact with a database. </p>
<p>If you would like more information look on the docs folder </p>
<p>This is a flask API which also has a front end interface which you can use to book directly or book only using the API</p>
